I have decided to focus on validating the data from the key financial metrics (P/E, debt to equity, return on equity, free cash flow and 5-year cagr revenue). Trying to do so without comparing yfinance's data to subscription APIs.

Project has reach a high level of complexity. Identified and implemented 6 core metrics for all industries:

1. Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow

2. (3 Year) Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate

3. Operating Margin 

4. Free Cash Flow Margin 

5. Net Debt to EBITDA 

6. Interest Coverage 

Key insight while working on this project is that what 'value' means for each company depends on its industry, business model and how well the company is doing compared to its peers.
