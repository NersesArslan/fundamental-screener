Hi, I'm trying to learn git and the fundamentals of python.

The purpose of this project is threefold: 

1. It's to help me identify value stocks for long term investment and growth stocks that can appreciate in a relatively short time than I can still hold on to (NVDA).

Some of the key features I want in it is to help me identify when is a good time to buy, hold and sell a stock based on its fundamental analysis. For simplicity, the purpose of the app is to help me identify what stocks to buy for long term investment. 

2. To help me solidify my basic understanding of fundamentals of programming. I have been using LLMs like Copilot and Claude to help me build this project. Project based-learning has to far been the best way I have learned everything I know about web development and programming. However, I often struggle to commit to a project long and consistently enough for it to be useful. My desire to become a better programmer by taking a deeper dive into git, learning basic 

I've been working on this app on an off since I had the idea. But I've been struggling with moving forward when I make progress because I use LLMs like Claude and Copilot (Microsoft Copilot) and the copilot agent integrated with VSCode. 
I'm able to prompt code to get the project to a certain point, I'm basically able to reach the stage where I can get each stock's data. But things get more difficult when I try to modify and change or add certain features. It seems like the more I use LLMs to even do basic things in the beginning, the less I tend to pay attention to the code, much less read it (especially when my ideas for how to move forward with the project move faster than my discipline to sit down and read and understand the code).

The main struggle is to maintain consistency and discipline with what to focus on  and where to move forward, even though I've established what step needs working on. My mind gets scattered tryign to understand code that I end up moving between different LLM's instead of understanding the fundamentals. 

So this project is an attempt to learn and re-learn the fundamentals of programming as much as it is trying to build a stock screener that is built on my desire to filter for
