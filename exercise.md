Hi, I'm trying to learn git and the fundamentals of python.

The purpose of this project is threefold: 

1. It's to help me identify value stocks for portfolio, but more importantly, it's to keep me engaged in learning about investing, finance and how markets work. The desire to earn money is always there but the long-term desire to keep learning about markets and how to properly screen value stocks. For example, I learned about fundamental analysis and some essential metrics (PE ratio, debt to equity, return on investment, free cash flow, 5 - CAGR). However, after doing more research on this I realized that to more precisely determine the value of a company's stock, it's not enough to screen for their metrics. When selecting and comparing a company to invest in, we need to compare its metrics with it's industry peers, not any other company. 

2. To help me solidify my basic understanding of fundamentals of programming. I have been using LLMs like Copilot and Claude to help me build this project. Project based-learning has to far been the best way I have learned everything I know about web development and programming. However, I often struggle to commit to a project long and consistently enough for it to be useful. My desire to become a better programmer fuels my desire to see through this project. I notice that I have a lot of bad practice habits (like usinhg `git add .`, not committing enough after meaningful changes in my project,  or relying alot on LLM's to generate code to add or modify my project and copy pasting error messages without taking the time to read them myself) and I realized the first step to becoming a better programmer is to become better at starting with these frustrating yet simple habits. 


3. I have a strong desire to earn enough money to support my family.
