# Fundamentals-Driven Stock Screener

A modular, fundamentals-first stock screening system designed to evaluate companies
through **explicit economic theses**, rather than generic factor models or price prediction.

This project asks a simple but demanding question:

> *How well does a business convert its core advantage (scale, growth, demand aggregation,
> or capital investment) into durable shareholder returns?*

The system is intentionally:
- **Comparative, not predictive**
- **Business-model aware**
- **Explicit about assumptions**
- **Resistant to silent overfitting**

## Core Principles

- **Separation of concerns**
  - Metrics compute economic concepts only
  - Scoring applies explicit weights
  - Experiments express investment theses
- **Price ≠ Quality**
  - Valuation is contextual, not absolute
- **Durability over narrative**
  - Preference for demonstrated operating leverage over promised future scale
- **Interpretability first**
  - Every ranking should be explainable in economic terms
